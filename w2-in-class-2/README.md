# Week 2 In-Class Activity 2

## Get HTTP Calls

You will go to the TomTom GPS website and call the point of interest webservice that will require you to use direct GET HTTP calls. 

I would suggest going through the documentation and the API Explorer tab to find what you need – https://developer.tomtom.com.

You will do a point of interest search for pizza shops.  Return the name, street number, street name and phone number of each one.  You may pick your home town’s latitude and longitude coordinates.

Be forewarned, some addresses will not have a street number.
