# Week 1 - Lab 1

For this lab you will create an invoice based on an XML file.  You need to use XPath statements to parse out the information – if you simply walk through the file line by line, or something equivalent to that technique, you will receive no credit for this lab.  If you aren’t sure if you are using the proper technique for this lab, please show me what you are doing so I can make sure.

The invoice will be based on the OrderInfo.xml file that will be provided via Canvas.
The invoice needs to have the following sections:

- Billing Information
- Shipping Information
- Item Information – with customer options if applicable

There are to be two additional line items, these are to be determined via one XPath statement each, do not loop through your code to determine the values.

- Number of items bought
- Total cost of the order

You may choose the output format of the invoice but it is to be presentable (i.e. carriage returns, look logical, etc.).
